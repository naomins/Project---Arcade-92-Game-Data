This is a C++ project that I completed for Jason Smith - CS 1337 - UTD.

Goal: To develop a C++ program to manage player game data using linked lists for efficient addition, editing, searching, deleting, and sorting of player records.

This program implements file handling to read and store player details from a database file.

Player records include: name, high score, initials, numebr of plays, and revenue.

Note that plays and revenue are dependant upon each other (revenue = plays * 0.25).
